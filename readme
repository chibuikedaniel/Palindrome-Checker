# Palindrome Checker

A simple web application that checks whether a given input is a palindrome.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. 

Examples of palindromes:
- "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
- "race a car"
- "Never odd or even"
- "Do geese see God?"

In this application, we consider a string to be a palindrome if, after removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, it reads the same forward and backward.

## Description

This Palindrome Checker is a single-page web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a word or phrase and checks if it's a palindrome based on the definition above.

## Features

- Input field for entering text
- "Check Palindrome" button to initiate the check
- Displays result indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not
- Alerts user if no input is provided
- Ignores spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for palindromes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file:
   ```
   git clone 
   ```
   Or simply download the `index.html` file.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

That's it! No additional setup or installation is required.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Enter a word or phrase in the input field.
3. Click the "Check Palindrome" button.
4. The result will be displayed below the button, indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Examples

- Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
  Result: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama is a palindrome"

- Input: "race a car"
  Result: "race a car is not a palindrome"

- Input: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
  Result: "Was it a car or a cat I saw? is a palindrome"

## Technical Details

- The application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- It uses the a custom  `alert()` function for error messages (e.g., when no input is provided).
- The palindrome checking algorithm removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase before comparison.
